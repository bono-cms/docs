Stylesheet and JavaScript files
==========================

You should avoid writing in-line scripts and stylesheets as much as possible. There are three main reasons to avoid them:

External JS and CSS files can be easily compressed, while with in-line ones you might have problems They can be loaded from browser's cache, while inline ones. They improve readability of a document. You'd feel it when you start adding new layers to your markup. In Bono, there's a helper to manage which is called Plugin Bag. It has following methods:
 

# getStylesheets()

Returns an array of all registered stylesheets.

# getScripts()

Similarly returns an array of all registered scripts.

You would usually do call these two main methods in your layout file.

 

# Example: Common usage in layout

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
     <meta charset="UTF-8" />
     <title>My new cool web-site</title>
     
     <?php foreach ($this->getPluginBag()->getStylesheets() as $stylesheet): ?>
     <link href="<?php echo $stylesheet; ?>" rel="stylsheet" />
     <?php endforeach; ?>
    </head>
     
     <body>
          
        <!-- Layout content goes here -->
    
       <?php foreach ($this->getPluginBag()->getScripts() as $script): ?>
       <script src="<?php echo $script; ?>"></script>
       <?php endforeach; ?>
       
     </body>
     </html>

That's it. Note, it's considered as a best practice to place scripts at the end of the document, so that pages load a bit faster, but it's not a must, however.
