Normalizing asset paths
=======================

By default, you usually have local paths to assets in your templates. Typically in your local document their paths look like so :

     <script src="js/jquery.min.js"><script>
     <link href="css/styles.css" />
     
     ...
     
     <img src="img/logo.png" />

 
Now to make assets aware of new theme's assets locations, you have to wrap those paths anywhere you'd encounter in the document into `<?php echo $this->asset(...); ?>`, so it would look like as following

     <script src="<?php echo $this->asset('js/jquery.min.js'); ?>"><script>
     <link href="<?php echo $this->asset('css/styles.css'); ?>" />
 
    ...
     <img src="<?php echo $this->asset('img/logo.png'); ?>" />

 
So you're done with paths normalization. Just make sure you wrap old asset paths everywhere you encounter in your theme documents.
