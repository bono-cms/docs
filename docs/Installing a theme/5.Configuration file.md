Configuration file
==============

Configuration file tells the system what to load and its always represented as PHP array in theme's folder. You need to create a file which is called `theme.config.php` inside theme's directory, That file must return PHP-array which usually looks like as following

    <?php
    
    return array(
       'plugins' => array(
          'jquery',
          // Another plugins to load
       ),
       theme => array(
          'stylesheets' => array(
             '/css/styles.css'
          ),
          'script' => array(
             '/js/app.js'
           )
       )
    ); 

As you can see there are two keys plugins and theme that return an array. A plugin is just a name, which is defined in `/config/view.php`. A plugin's name simply defines asset paths to some client-side plugin. Theme's key has two keys, which return arrays of relative paths to theme's assets,
