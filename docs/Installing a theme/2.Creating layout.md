Creating layout
===============

# What is a layout?

A layout is a special file which contains all global HTML blocks, like footer, header and sidebar. For example, if you have a some kind of e-commerce theme, in all its pages, you'd encounter repetitive blocks which you can encounter in another pages as well. Most sites on the web have only one block which changes when jumping from one page to another, if you look closely. Chances, your theme is not that different in terms of repetitive blocks. What you need to do is to find out what part of your theme is actual global site layout. In most cases that looks like as following:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
      <title>My new theme</title>
      <link href="..." rel="stylesheet" />
      <script scr="..."></script>
    </head>
    <body>
      <header>
        <!--Header content usually goes here-->
      </header>
      
      <ul>
        <!--Stuff like breadcrumbs or navigation-->
      </ul>
      
      <div id="content">
         <!--Dynamic page fragment goes here-->
      </div>
      
    </body>
    </html>

As you might already guess, dynamic page fragment is the content which usually comes from another pages. To make it work, there's a pre-defined variable which is called `$fragment`. All you need to do is to echo it, just like this:

      <div id="content">
         <?php echo $fragment; ?>
      </div>

  
Once you finish building a layout, you must save it as a file inside theme's directory, which must be called `__layout__.phtml`
