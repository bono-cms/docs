Breadcrumbs
===========

Breadcrumbs typically show visitors where they are. If you have breadcrumbs in your template, to make use of them, you would simply access using breadcrumb's bag instance in your templates. Everything will be prepared automatically for you. You only need to iterate over breadcrumb's array in your template!


Some pages might have no breadcrumbs, (like home pages) and firstly you need to make sure, that there's at least one available breadcrumb. To do so, you can simply check out `$this->getBreadcrumbBag()->has()` returned value. It returns true or false

Once you make sure, that you can go on, the next step will be iterating over available array. Each key's value represents an instance of current breacrumb with three available methods:

# getName()

Returns a name of current breadcrumb.

# getLink()

 Returns a link of current breadcrumb.

# isActive()

 Returns boolean value, which indicates if current breadcrumb is active.
 

# Example: Typical usage

You can simple copy-paste this template fragment and insert it directly in your markup where it's appropriate.

    <?php if ($this->getBreadcrumbBag()->has()): ?>
    <ul class="breadcrumb">
       <?php foreach ($this->getBreadcrumbBag()->getBreadcrumbs() as $breadcrumb): ?>
       
       <?php if ($breadcrumb->isActive()): ?>
       <li class="active"><?php echo $breadcrumb->getName(); ?></li>
       <?php else: ?>
       <li><a href="<?php echo $breadcrumb->getLink(); ?>"><?php echo $breadcrumb->getName(); ?></a></li>
       <?php endif; ?>
       
       <?php endforeach; ?>
    </ul>
    <?php endif; ?>

 

That's how breadcrumb's fragment should look like in most cases. However if you have another one which is different from provided one, you'd simply use available methods this way.
