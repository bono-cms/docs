 Setting up
=========

Before you start installing a theme, you need to create a directory for it and define its value in configuration file. 

# Creating theme's directory
All site theme directories must be located in its corresponding module, which is `Site`. So go to `/module/Site/View/Template` and create a new directory, which represents a name of your theme. For example, that could be `my-new-theme`. Now copy all your theme files into the directory you have just created.

# Configuration

To let the system know what theme theme to load, you must define its name in configuration. That configuration's item is stored in `/config/view.php`. So go there and open that file.

You will see something like this:

    return array(
      'theme' => 'bono-simple', 
      //....
    )

 

As you might already guessed, you only need to replace the value of theme. Remember the name we used when creating a directory? That name was my-new-theme, so the new value must be named accordingly:

    return array(
      'theme' => 'my-new-theme', 
      //....
    )

You're done setting up. Now system knows what theme to load on start. But your theme doesn't work yet, so let's move on to the next step.
